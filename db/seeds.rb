On smaller swells with an outgoing tide, you can count on steep, peaky, left-handers. Typically Balangan will hold a steep wall for a short ride before some sections close out. At times but under perfect conditions, it has been known to connect the whole length of the reef (over 300 meters). Choose your peak and tide accordingly, although Balangan can be surfed on all tides it is the more experienced surfers that only surf it on low tides and big swells. While not necessarily recommended for beginner surfers it is mellow on a higher tide and small swell. If you can keep up your speed to make the sections (and it doesn‚Äôt close out), you‚Äôre in for an open shoulder ripe for plenty of maneuvers.", beach_type: "sandy", about_location: "Historically nestled into sleepy farmland on the Bukit peninsula, new development makes Balangan a bit more exciting than it once was. Today, Balangan beach is bordered by golf courses with breathtaking sea views of pristine beaches and limestone cliffs.", punchline: "Feel this hot clean white sand... :ensoleill√©:")
